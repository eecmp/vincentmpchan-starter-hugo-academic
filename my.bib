	abstract = {It is well known from control theory that 2$^{\textrm{nd}}$-order boundary control is able to achieve a faster transient response over the conventional hysteretic control. However, no available monolithic 2$^{\textrm{nd}}$-order boundary controller for buck converter has not been found. The main challenges of designing this controller are the implementation of the non-invasion output capacitor current sensor and the hardware calculation of both positive and negative squared terms in the 2$^{\textrm{nd}}$-boundary control law. This paper overcomes those challenges and successfully designed and fabricated the controller with a standard 0.35\&\#x00B5;m CMOS process. Measurement results show that, during a 400mA load current step change, the controller is able to regulate a 4MHz buck converter output voltage to return to its nominal value within one ON/OFF switching action (1\&\#x00B5;s) with less than 50mV overshoot/undershoot. The measured highest power efficiency is about 94\%.},

	abstract = {Digital current-mode control is a dual-loop control which potentially results in a better transient response and thus is more favorable than voltage-mode control. There are only a few publications on how to design and implement a fully integrated digital controller as the on-chip implementation is very challenging, especially for current-mode control. This paper addresses those design challenges and considerations. One of the main challenges is to efficiently sample and quantize both the output voltage and inductor current of the buck converter for control purposes. A time-multiplex scheme is used for the control-loop which enables the converter to work with a single ADC. A modified delay-lock-loop DPWM has been developed for minimizing the mismatch of the delay-cells. This enhances the accuracy at high frequency to prevent limit-cycle. A new algorithm has also been proposed for implementing look-up-table digital compensators with 20\% less chip area. A converter with the fully integrated digitally controlled loop, including the single ADC, digital compensators and DPWM, has been fabricated in a CMOS 0.35 \&\#x03BC; m process with a chip area of 1049 \&\#x03BC;m \&\#x00D7; 1533 \&\#x03BC;m. Measurement results show that the buck converter has a load transient response of 20 \&\#x03BC;s, which is one of the fastest compared to other state-of-the-art digitally controlled buck converter.},

The Self-Strobe Delay-Line (SSDL) ADC architecture has been used because of its low-power and high-speed characteristics. However, the transconductance gain of the V-I converter in the SSDL ADC have not been optimized to have high sensitivity with low power consumption. In this paper, a differential sensing circuit was designed to obtain high transconductance gain without costing extra power and chip area. With the improved ADC, the digital controller IC was implemented with 0.35 mum CMOS process.

In most of the existing approaches, the digital inductor current-sensing and quantization are always designed and implemented as two separated functional blocks, e.g. an analog current sensor and an ADC. This is actually a redundant approach and designing a high-gain amplifier in deep sub-micron process is power consuming. Therefore, this paper proposed an on-chip digital inductor current sensor which combines both the sensing and quantization into a single functional block. In this way, chip area and power consumption can be saved. An 8-bit digital inductor current sensor for 4MHz buck converter is designed and implemented.

	abstract = {Conventionally, inductor current is sensed and quantized before it can be used by digitally controlled DC-DC converters. These are intuitively done by using two separated functional blocksâ€”an analog current sensor and an ADC. A few research works have investigated other ways of obtaining the inductor current information in the digital domain. This paper proposes an on-chip digital inductor current sensor that combines both the inductor current-sensing and quantization into a single functional block. In this way, the redundancies found in the conventional approach can be reduced and optimizations can be made to save chip area and power consumption. An 8-bit digital inductor current sensor has been designed and fabricated with a UMC 0.13 \$ murm m\$ CMOS process. The measurement results show that the digital sensor can provide digital inductor current information with a conversion time of 225 ns. This can be used by a buck converter with a switching frequency up to 4 MHz. The digital sensor has linear and monotonic input-output transfer curve properties with an LSB of 6.79 mA. It consumes current of 700\$ murm A\$ at 1.2 V supply voltage.},

	abstract = {A ripple-based control scheme for DC-DC converters is presented which can fast load-transient responses by sensing inductor current and using it as feedback ripples. Conventionally, analog RC inductor current sensors can be used for that purpose.

Therefore, this paper proposes a digital inductor current sensor that does not require the extra ADCs and occupies a small chip area. A ripple-based digital controller has been implemented to demonstrate how the digital sensor can be utilized.
